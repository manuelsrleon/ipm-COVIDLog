# COVIDLog
This was an assignment made in academic year 21-22 as part of a subject called Interfaces Persona Máquina (user interfaces). It is the second part of a **three-piece assignment** consisting on three separate applications (desktop, mobile and web) which **revolve around the querying, logging and searching** of COVID contacts. Of course, this was done during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic.

This is an Android app build using Dart and Flutter, which I found to be tremendously versatile and well documented.

Design docs for all of the three projects are available on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/y2LgbOJngQ7VbYIJWtJ40b/COVIDLog?node-id=0%3A1)

The Hasura (GraphQL) backend was provided to us by Noelia Barreira Rodríguez (noelia.barreira@udc.es), and is publicly available on [her repository](github.com/nbarreira/ipm2122-server)

_Keep in mind that design considerations were secondary, as pretty UI design was hardly valued and we only had the time that was strictly necessary to comply with the non-functional requirements proposed by the teachers._
